<p>My name is Matt Vukas and I'm a Software Engineer from Denver, Colorado. I graduated from Indiana University in May 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science from the School of Informatics and Computing and a Business minor from the Kelley School of Business. I currently work for Placeable, an Internet marketing company based in Denver.</p>
<p>I've been fascinated with computers ever since I unboxed my family's first PC, a bulky, beige Dell, and dialed in at a blazing fast 56kbps (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs" target="_blank">oh, nostalgia</a>)Â to AOL. That was around 1997, and we've come a very long way since then.</p>
<p>In my free time, I try to hike as much as possible and generally enjoy the beauty of Colorado. But I also like learning new technologies and working on side projects. These days I mainly blog about software: new technologies, challenges I run into on projects, and tech industry news.</p>
