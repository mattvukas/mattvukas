<p>My name is Matt Vukas, and I am a Software Engineer and tech enthusiast. I graduated from Indiana University in May 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science from the School of Informatics and Computing and a Business minor from the Kelley School of Business.</p>
<p>I've been fascinated with computers ever since I unboxed my family's first PC, a bulky, beige Dell, and dialed in at a blazing fast 56kbps (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs" target="_blank">oh, nostalgia</a>)Â to AOL. That was around 1997, and we've come a very long way since then.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest tech news and learning new things whenever I can. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems, open source software, and digital currency. I also like to keep up with free speech issues, Internet regulation, and the rise of technology in emerging economies.</p>
<p>Through this blog, I hope to share helpful things I've learned through work or personal experience, in addition to passing on news and other interesting stuff I come across. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
