<p>Tumblr and blogging newcomer Medium are taking the online publishing world by storm. Yahoo purchased Tumblr for over $1 billion last year, and Medium is picking up steam, led by two co-founders of Twitter. I figured this would be a fitting topic to write about for my first post on Medium. Here's the link:</p>
<p><script async src="https://static.medium.com/embed.js"></script><a class="m-story" data-collapsed="true" href="https://medium.com/@mattvukas/medium-tumblr-and-the-re-consolidation-of-online-publishing-88d2d8b29bcc">Medium, Tumblr, and the re-consolidation of online publishing</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure how I'm going to reconcile the existence of this Wordpress site with my new Medium account. It depends on how much I like Medium; I may keep them both updated in parallel, I may migrate everything over to Medium, or I may ditch Medium and keep writing here if it doesn't work out. For the time being, I'll just cross-promote. Cheers!</p>
