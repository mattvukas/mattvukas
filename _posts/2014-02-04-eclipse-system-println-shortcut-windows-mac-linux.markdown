<p>Ever since I wrote a post detailing <a href="http://mattvukas.com/2013/07/01/eclipse-keyboard-shortcuts-a-few-that-every-developer-should-know/">a few important keyboard shortcuts in Eclipse</a> last summer, I've been getting a surprising amount of search engine traffic all looking for one shortcut in particular: <strong>System.out.println()</strong>. Since this is such an important shortcut to know for debugging or writing Java in general, I decided to break it out into its own post.</p>

<h2>The Shortcut</h2><br />
To use this shortcut, open up the Eclipse editor and navigate to the spot in the file where you would like to place this function. Now just <b>type "syso", followed by CTRL + SPACE</b>. Eclipse will magically fill out the full <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/formatting.html">System.out.println()</a> function call and place your cursor in between the parentheses, so that you can easily type in your desired output. This trick works exactly the same, whether you're on a Windows, Mac, or Linux version of Eclipse.</p>
<h2>Note for Mac users</h2><br />
As I stated above, this shortcut uses the <em>Control</em> key, not the <em>Command</em> key that is more commonly used in other Mac applications for shortcuts. <em>Command + Space</em> opens up a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2531">Mac Spotlight Search</a> prompt at the system level, so that shortcut wouldn't be available for Eclipse to use anyway.</p>
