excerpt: Some side projects I've worked on over the years.

<p>
  Take a peek at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattvukas/">my LinkedIn</a> to see what I've been
  working on professionally.
</p>
<p>Listed below are a few side projects I've worked on recently.</p>
<h2>MattVukas.com</h2>
<p>
  Yup, this website is a project in and of itself, and <a href="https://github.com/mattvukas/mattvukas.github.io">you
    can find the public repository for it here</a>. I started with a minimalist <a
    href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> template and have tweaked it quite a bit over the years. After struggling
  with overcomplicated and bloated WordPress sites, I wanted something simple and fast, with the content front and
  center. For a static site that changes rarely, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> certainly delivers
  simplicity and speed, netting this site a <a href="/images/mattvukas-com-pagespeed.jpg">perfect 100</a> on <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>.
</p>
<h2>React Node Template</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/mattvukas/react-node-template">React Node Template</a> is a web app template I put
  together in early 2020. It's based off of full stack JavaScript patterns I've used both on the job and in personal
  side projects. Prioritizing rapid development and turnkey deployment to the cloud, I've always wanted to open source a
  project and this seemed like a good place to start (offered under the permissive <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>). I kept this template extremely simple and
  unopinionated, but might add to it in the future or write some tutorials based off of it.
</p>
<h2>Simple Blocker</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://simpleblocker.com">Simple Blocker</a> is a Google Chrome browser extension that I created.
  Development began in March 2013, and I consider it to be in a "mature" state as of April 2015. Simple Blocker is a
  free app which allows you to block any number of websites that you specify, with the end goal of boosting
  productivity. You can block websites for a specified amount of time, or lock the app with a password and block those
  websites indefinitely. I use the app myself whenever I have trouble focusing a particular task or work in general.
