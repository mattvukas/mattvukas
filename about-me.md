My name is Matt Vukas and I'm a Software Engineer living in Denver, Colorado. I graduated from Indiana University in May 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I currently work for [Flowhub](https://flowhub.co/), a software company based in Denver.

I've been fascinated with computers ever since I unboxed my family's first PC, a bulky, beige Dell, and dialed in at a blazing fast 56kbps ([oh, nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs))Â to AOL. That was around 1997, and we've come a very long way since then.

In my free time, I try to hike & ski as much as possible and generally enjoy the beauty of Colorado. But I also like learning new technologies and working on [side projects](/projects). These days I mainly blog about software: new technologies, challenges I run into on projects, cryptocurrencies, and tech industry news.
