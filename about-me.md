My name is Matt Vukas, welcome to my personal website and blog! This is a living portfolio, stream of consciousness, and repository of articles authored by yours truly. I'm a technologist; my current role is a software engineer at [Flowhub](https://flowhub.co/), and I have worked in software engineering at several [SaaS startups](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas) and other organizations before that (see [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattvukas/) for more info).

I live in [Denver, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver). I grew up in Carmel, Indiana and attended [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) in Bloomington, Indiana, graduating in May 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science. My journey took me from Bloomington to a brief stint in Kansas City, then to Denver in 2015, where I've lived ever since. Since moving here, I've learned a ton, not just about how to deliver software, but also how to ski, how to climb [14ers](https://www.14ers.com/), how to [sample beers](https://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/), and much more.

I've been fascinated with computers ever since I unboxed my family's first PC, a bulky, beige Dell, and dialed in at a blazing fast 56kbps ([oh, nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs))Â to AOL. That was around 1997, and we've come a very long way since then.

In my free time, I try to hike & ski as much as possible and generally enjoy the beauty of Colorado. But I also like learning new technologies and working on [side projects](/projects). These days I mainly blog about software: new technologies, challenges I run into on projects, cryptocurrencies, and tech industry news.
