My name is Matt Vukas, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Flowhub](https://flowhub.co/) living in Denver, Colorado. I grew up in Carmel, Indiana and attended [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) in Bloomington, Indiana, graduating in May 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science. My journey took me from Bloomington to a brief stint in Kansas City, then to Denver in 2015, where I've worked for a few [SaaS companies](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas), learned a ton, met some great people, gone on some amazing adventures, and put down roots by buying a house.

I've been fascinated with computers ever since I unboxed my family's first PC, a bulky, beige Dell, and dialed in at a blazing fast 56kbps ([oh, nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs))Â to AOL. That was around 1997, and we've come a very long way since then.

In my free time, I try to hike & ski as much as possible and generally enjoy the beauty of Colorado. But I also like learning new technologies and working on [side projects](/projects). These days I mainly blog about software: new technologies, challenges I run into on projects, cryptocurrencies, and tech industry news.
